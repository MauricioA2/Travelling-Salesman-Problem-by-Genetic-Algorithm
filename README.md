# Travelling Salesman Problem by Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a solution to the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. 
The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. 
The algorithm is based on evolutionary principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

This project was developed as part of the **"Temas Selectos de Estad√≠stica"** course.

## Features

- Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem using a Genetic Algorithm.
- Allows the user to specify the number of cities and their coordinate range.
- Visualizes the best solution found as a plot of the cities and the route.
- Includes basic genetic operations: selection, crossover, and mutation.
